# Augmentra Code Test


This  application can deal with maths problem like 4+5/2 or 12*2+6/3+2-3. To solve such simple maths problems, the app ensures it follows BODMAS (Brace open >> Divisio >> Multiplication >> Addition >> Subtraction operations order by implementing reverse polish notation algorithm.

The app has also included tests to check the operations are performing correctly and user's inputs are valid.
The app follows MVP design pattern. This design pattern gives the app concern separation feature and writing tests for the app is easy and bug free with design pattern.
